```
type [-aftpP] name [name ...]
              With  no  options,  indicate  how each name would be interpreted if used as a command name.  If the -t option is used, type prints a string which is one of alias,
              keyword, function, builtin, or file if name is an alias, shell reserved word, function, builtin, or disk file, respectively.  If the name is not found, then noth‐
              ing  is  printed, and an exit status of false is returned.  If the -p option is used, type either returns the name of the disk file that would be executed if name
              were specified as a command name, or nothing if ``type -t name'' would not return file.  The -P option forces a PATH search for  each  name,  even  if  ``type  -t
              name'' would not return file.  If a command is hashed, -p and -P print the hashed value, not necessarily the file that appears first in PATH.  If the -a option is
              used, type prints all of the places that contain an executable named name.  This includes aliases and functions, if and only if the -p option is  not  also  used.
              The  table  of hashed commands is not consulted when using -a.  The -f option suppresses shell function lookup, as with the command builtin.  type returns true if
              all of the arguments are found, false if any are not found.
